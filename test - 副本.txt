People always think that the babies know nothing about the world, so that they don¡¯t know what they are doing and their mistakes can be forgiven all the time. Actually, according to the new research, the babies have their own recognition, they make judgement by observing parents¡¯ reaction.
For example, if the baby wants to buy the toy, he will point to the toy or just stand there. Most parents will realize the baby¡¯s need and satisfy him. So the baby has learned that if they do the same thing, they can get what they want. The worse thing is that when the baby makes mistakes, the parents think it is natural for him and won¡¯t correct them. Then the baby will become naughty.
My aunt¡¯s baby is the example. My aunt tell me that she thinks the baby is too small and there is no need to take it serious. So she feels tired to look after the baby. But there is a mother who lives next to her. My aunt tells me that her neighbour¡¯s baby behaves well, later I find that the mother always corrects her baby¡¯s mistake.
The parents should realize the importance of baby¡¯s recognition, so that they can better educate the babys.
